# BCIT NB IoT

There are 2 (potentially 3) npm project root folders.
- /
    - back-end folder with express server

- /client
    - front-end that will contain the react code and apexcharts. 
    - anyone working solely on the front-end will probably just need to write inside this folder

- /lambda (pending)
    - will contain the lambda code
